%% Fra instruksjonene, om \aclfinalcopy :

%% By uncommenting {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} at the top of this document, it
%% will compile to produce an example of the camera-ready formatting; by leaving
%% it commented out, the document will be anonymized for initial submission.  When
%% you first create your submission on softconf, please fill in your submitted
%% paper ID where {\small\verb|***|} appears in the
%% {\small\verb|\def\aclpaperid{***}|} definition at the top.

%% The review process is double-blind, so do not include any author information
%% (names, addresses) when submitting a paper for review.  However, you should
%% maintain space for names and addresses so that they will fit in the final
%% (accepted) version.  The ACL 2016 \LaTeX\ style will create a titlebox space of
%% 2.5in for you when {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} is commented out.

%% \subsection{The Ruler}
%% The ACL 2016 style defines a printed ruler which should be presented in the
%% version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
%% reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
%% circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document without the provided
%% style files, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
%% appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
%% should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
%% camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment
%% the {\small\verb|\aclfinalcopy|} command in the document preamble.)
